Turning on a VPN is always a painful experience on an iOS device due to the deep nested menus. This App installs a Today Widget into Notification Center which make it possible to turn on a VPN in about 3 seconds(depends on the connection speed). Furthermore, by turning on On Demand feature, the VPN could be automatically connected when you visit any domain specified in this App.

## Requirements

- An iPhone/iPad running iOS 8.0+
- An IPSec IKEv1 / IKEv2 VPN(create yours with [my Ansible Playbook](https://github.com/lexrus/vpn-deploy-playbook) or [deploy on DigitalOcean](http://installer.71m.us/install?url=https://github.com/lexrus/do-ikev1))
- Xcode 7+
- [Carthage](https://github.com/carthage/carthage)
- An Apple iOS developer account

## Build with Xcode

Install dependencies with `carthage update --platform ios`.

To compile the project, you may temporarily modify the bundle_id after adding yours into the Apple Developer Center. And then activate the following capabilities of the container App and the Today extension:

1. Personal VPN
2. Keychain Sharing
3. App Groups

Meanwhile, provisioning profiles are required for testing on iPhone/iPad.

## Usage

After creating a VPN configuration you can activate the Today Widget in Notification Center, then turn on the VPN by tapping switches or flags. You may be asked to allow the installation of a VPN profile for the first time.

## Contribution

Issues and roadmap are [listed here](https://github.com/lexrus/VPNOn/issues).

This project follows the [gitflow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow) workflow. You'd better create a branch called `feature/sth_improved` before any major improvements. Meanwhile minor bug fixes are welcomed in the develop branch.

## Localization

Please contribute to [the Transifex project](https://www.transifex.com/lexrus/vpnon/).

## URL Schemes

### Add configuration

VPN service providers may list a link for their customers to efficiently add server configurations in VPN On. By register the `vpnon://` protocol, it supports the following URL scheme:

`vpnon://{account}:{password}@{server}/?title={title}&group={group}&secret={secret}&alwayson=[yes|no]&ikev2=[yes|no]`

`server` and `title` are required, other fields are optional. The following URLs are valid:

* `vpnon://jony:ive@apple.com/?title=Apple&group=Design&secret=iPhone`
* `vpnon://apple.com/?title=Apple`
* `vpnon://admin@192.168.0.123/?title=Google&group=devops`
* `vpnon://admin@202.96.209.6/?title=Yahoo&alwayson=no`
* `vpnon://jony:ive@202.96.209.5/?title=Twitter&ikev2=yes`

### Establish connection

* `vpnon://VPNTitle/?connect`
* `vpnon://VPNTitle/?connect&callback=https://twitter.com`

### Disconnect

* `vpnon://disconnect/`
